For detail description of dataset and features, Please go through **https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/spect/SPECTF.names**

This dataset contains 45 features and we have to predict whether the pateient health is normal or abnormal.

By applying PCA, we have reduced number of features to 20 which explained 95% of the variance in the data and then applied Random Forest Algorithm to predict the output.
